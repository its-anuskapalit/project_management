00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.390
In this video, we will discuss

2
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.865
two project management
methodologies.

3
00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.550
The first is the
predictive model.

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.075
This is also called waterfall
in software development.

5
00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.685
The predictive model follows

6
00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:26.925
a more linear path for
project scheduling.

7
00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:30.330
We'll compare that with
Agile project management,

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.605
which uses more of an iterative
process to place value

9
00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:39.965
on providing the customer
deliverables more frequently.

10
00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.845
There are different lifecycles
in project management.

11
00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:45.230
First, let's take a look at

12
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.255
the predictive
project management

13
00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:51.560
or traditional project
management style.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.370
You will use this project
methodology where

15
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.645
your milestones are more
defined and more sequenced.

16
00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:02.510
This methodology also doesn't

17
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.595
really respond well to changes.

18
00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:06.980
It isn't as Agile, if you will.

19
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.045
It follows the stages
of initiating,

20
00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.565
planning, executing,

21
00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:16.745
controlling, and
monitoring, and closing.

22
00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.560
In each of these stages have

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.440
well-defined
processes and tools.

24
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.950
When it comes to managing
the project schedule,

25
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.465
it may follow a stage gate
process more on this later.

26
00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:34.280
Then we have a project
management called Agile.

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.660
An Agile project
management is one that

28
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.700
prioritizes creating value
through quicker releases.

29
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.980
While traditional
project management

30
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.815
doesn't respond well to change,

31
00:01:47.815 --> 00:01:50.270
Agile welcomes changes to

32
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.610
the project and to
the project schedule.

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.445
In this slide, we have

34
00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.140
a graphical example of

35
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.150
a predictive methodology in

36
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.520
terms of the project timeline.

37
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.920
In the traditional schedule,

38
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.584
the approach is linear.

39
00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:10.790
All phases of the project will

40
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.805
occur in a predicted sequence.

41
00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:15.470
The project team must first

42
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.390
complete planning
before moving on to

43
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.730
execution and then verification

44
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.655
and then delivery
to the customer.

45
00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:25.334
The project manager plans
the schedule upfront.

46
00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:27.500
They try to reduce the risk of

47
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.980
any schedule changes or
scope changes because

48
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.945
the predictive model
doesn't really

49
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:37.570
allow many changes in the model.

50
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.605
Since all the planning is
done in the beginning,

51
00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:44.410
there isn't any changes due
to the scope or the budget.

52
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.950
If there are those changes,

53
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.930
they'll really throw
off your schedule.

54
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.525
Now let's compare this to
the Agile methodology.

55
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:56.375
The Agile method invite changes.

56
00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:00.850
It works on an editor
iterative process.

57
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.895
The Agile approach encourages
more frequent delivery.

58
00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:09.380
It really focuses on creating
value early and often.

59
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.480
This means that teams work more

60
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.980
collaboratively to plan

61
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.975
smaller iterations
of the project,

62
00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:16.775
execute on those iterations,

63
00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:18.335
on each smaller segment,

64
00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:20.420
verify them, and
then deliver them to

65
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.150
the customer again
to create value.

66
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.780
Now, this isn't to say
that Agile is better than

67
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.995
predictive in every situation
or for every project.

68
00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:33.260
Many projects lend themselves to

69
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.320
a traditional project
methodology very well.

70
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.370
Especially when the scope
is well-defined or if

71
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.480
the project is similar to a
previous successful project.

72
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.170
In this class, I will discuss
project scheduling from

73
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.215
the perspective of a
traditional project

74
00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:56.180
or a waterfall project.

75
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.189
But I did at least
want to introduce

76
00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.320
you to some of the
basic terminology of

77
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.730
project's schedules in terms
of Agile project management.

78
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.855
The Agile project manager
uses short cycles

79
00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:11.540
of planning and then jumps
right into execution.

80
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.930
This is all done in
something called sprints.

81
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.920
The project manager in Agile
is called the scrum master.

82
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.205
Project scheduling
and monitoring is

83
00:04:22.205 --> 00:04:25.580
often done using a
system called Kanban.

84
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.520
What Kanban is it's
essentially a work

85
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.980
in progress for the Agile team.

86
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.460
As parts of the
project progress,

87
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.590
they move across the
Kanban board from

88
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.944
left to right until they
are tested, validated,

89
00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:41.510
and delivered to the end-user

90
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.985
or to the customer
or to the client.

91
00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:47.495
Now, don't worry if this
all seems foreign to you,

92
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:50.330
especially if you've just
completed my first course.

93
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.480
I do have another course called
Agile project management,

94
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.335
where I will explain the
entire process in more detail.

95
00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:00.590
I just wanted to
introduce the concept of

96
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.660
the sprint sense
project scheduling

97
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.160
is vastly different
between the methodologies.

98
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.030
Now let's move on to
predictive models.
